- OH today and Monday

- HW2, HW1 makeup, all in-class polls due Monday EOD

- Final is Wednesday, 6-8pm

## Outline for today

Start with the poll

Cloud computing in AWS:

- Getting started; what to know up front

- Storing data (S3)

- Running computations (EC2 and Lambda)

If we have an extra 10-15 minutes at the end of class, I will reserve it for an open Q+A.

Questions about HW2 or the final or anything else?

## Poll

Getting the poll out of the way:

https://forms.gle/3e6vJHShMJfaD2pH8

A streaming system processes 20 input rows over the duration of 1 minute that the system is running. The system may use parallelism, meaning that at any given point in time, more than one input may be processed.

Given this information, what is the minimum and maximum latency for individual input rows?
