## Monday Oct 20

Announcements:

- Canvas and Piazza outage today :-)

    + Canvas still down, Piazza is back up

- My office hours are cancelled today! (I have to make a different appointment)

    **If you need to reach me:** I can be available for Zoom hours, I plan to hold these hours either today or tomorrow evening or Wednesday late afternoon. Please email me if you would like to attend office hours at one of these times and let me know which of these times you would be available.

- A quick note about uploading to Gradescope

    + Please do try to download your code and run it!

    + Part of why we are doing all of this work on the shell is to get you used to figuring out how/why
      programs do and don't run :-)

    + It is your responsibility to ensure that the autograder runs on your code.

Plan:

- Start with discussion question & poll

- Help commands and doing stuff commands

- Hope to get through most/all of remainder of lecture 2.

## Wednesday Oct 22

Full disclosure: we are a bit behind from where I wanted to be
at this point in the quarter!

I know I said we would try to finish the shell lecture last time,
but there are a couple of topics left that I want to cover
and these are part of the material for the midterm.

I will discuss more details about the midterm on Friday.

Announcements:

- None

Plan:

- Git

- Dangers of the shell

- Overview of advanced topics / things we didn't cover.
