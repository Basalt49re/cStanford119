- Schedule update

Plan for today:

- Poll

- Finish example from last time: Throughput & Latency

- Start lecture 2

  + Lecture 2 will focus on the shell (your terminal)

  + Then we will return to the main data processing content

### Poll

Finishing some definitions:

- Throughput = ...

- Often calculated as:

- Latency = ...

- Often calculated as:

For a cleaned up example, see lecture1/throughput_latency.py.

These concepts and terminology are fundamental in computer networking.
For example, you may have seen wifi network advertised in terms of
throughput or bandwidth in Mbps:

We will come back to this later on!
For now: the fundamental performance characteristics of ANY data processing
pipeline can be summarized by throughput and latency.
