## Friday, October 3

Thanks to the TA for running installation help office hours - hopefully you have been able to get your installation issues resolved!

- As of yesterday, most of you have everything working up to PySpark (with one or two still working on PySpark). You will need PySpark working for the latter part of the course.
  We found that:
  - for Windows, Java 11, Python 3.12.3, Pyspark 3.5.3 work
  - for Mac/WSL: Java 21 or 22 works.

Plan for today:

- Start with poll

- From ETL to Dataflow graphs

- A more realistic example to go through

- (If time) Failures and risks
