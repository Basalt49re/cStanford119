=== Advantages of software view ===

Advantages of thinking of data processing pipelines as software:

- Software *design* matters: structuring code into modules, classes, functions
- Software can be *tested*: validating functions, validating inputs, unit & integration tests
- Software can be *reused* and maintained (not just a one-off script)
- Software can be developed collaboratively (Git, GitHub)
- Software can be optimized for performance (parallelism, distributed computing, etc.)

It is a little more work to structure our code this way!
But it helps ensure that our work is reusable and integrates well with other teams, projects, etc.
